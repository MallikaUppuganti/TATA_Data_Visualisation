## üìå Project Summary

In this project, I stepped into the role of a Data Visualization Analyst, working with Sales and Operations data from a global retail company. My goal was to translate raw data into clear, actionable insights that would inform leadership decisions across executive and marketing teams.

Drawing inspiration from Tata Group's virtual simulation, I approached this as a real-world business challenge - anticipating stakeholder needs, crafting the right visual narratives and Data Storytelling with measurable business impact.

## üß© What I Did
**1.** Framed Business-Critical Questions
I began by identifying key questions a CEO and CMO might ask based on the dataset. For the CEO, I focused on high-level performance and country-wise revenue. For the CMO, I emphasized customer behavior, segmentation, and marketing ROI.

**2.** Matched Visuals to Insights
I selected and justified appropriate chart types - bar charts, line graphs, maps and pie charts‚Äîbased on the nature of each question. The goal was to ensure each visual was tailored to how the end-user interprets information.

**3.** Built Visualizations in Power BI

Using Power BI , I designed charts to visualize:

  * Sales trends over time

  * Country-level performance (excluding UK)

  * Customer segmentation and behavior

   * Product category analysis

**4.** Prepared the Data Story for Stakeholders

Finally, I created a video to present insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders. I explained what the data shows, why it matters and what actions can be taken.
